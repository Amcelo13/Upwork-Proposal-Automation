It’s a therapist-client based telephonic and video calling website designed specifically to support mental health in the Black community. I built the entire system end-to-end — including a scalable backend, secure payment infrastructure, and appointment scheduling. To enhance accessibility and engagement, I integrated an AI-powered avatar tool capable of generating personalized text-to-video messages with real-time translation, syncing three different services to work together seamlessly.\nI have delivered 4 MVP's within 6 months and doing thousands of users combined as my coding is accompained with AI that reduces delivery time and accuracy of the deliverables",
